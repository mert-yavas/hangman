# Hangman 

## Overview

Hello, it's Mert again! On Day 7 of my "100 Days of Python" challenge, I've taken on the task of creating the classic game of Hangman. In this Python version, you'll test your word-guessing skills while trying to avoid the hangman's noose.

## How It Works

The Hangman game is both challenging and educational:

1. The game randomly selects a word, and your objective is to guess it letter by letter.
2. You'll be prompted to guess a letter. If it's in the word, the letter will be revealed in its correct position.
3. If your guess is incorrect, a part of the hangman drawing appears, and you lose a life.
4. You have a limited number of lives to guess the word correctly. Use them wisely!
5. The game continues until you either guess the word or run out of lives.

## Features

- **Random Word Selection:** Each game features a new word from a predefined list, ensuring a unique experience every time.
- **Letter Validation:** Ensures that only valid alphabetic characters are accepted as guesses.
- **Replayability:** With multiple words and the element of randomness, no two games are the same.
- **Visual Feedback:** ASCII art stages visually represent the hangman and the remaining lives.

## Try It Out

Challenge yourself with this version of Hangman! Start the game, guess the letters, and try to figure out the word before the hangman drawing is completed. It's a perfect way to test your vocabulary and have fun. Enjoy and good luck!
